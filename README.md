# Pixi.js Experiment

1. To run the app, clone, fork or download it. 
2. Make sure you have Node and npm installed. 
3. Run ```npm install``` or ```npm i```
4. Then run ```npm run dev```

The app runs webpack dev server with hot reloading. So, any changes you make to ```index.js``` will rebuild the app.
